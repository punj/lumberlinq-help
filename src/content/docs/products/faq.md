## Products

### What is a Product in LumberLinq?

### Which product fields are required?

Product name, formula, and HS code are required. Species, product code, and description are optional.

### Which formula should I choose?

Use **Round Log** for round, unprocessed logs. Use **Square / Sawn** for sawn or rectangular timber.

### Can I change a product after using it?

You can edit product details, but be careful with formula changes because linked measurements and operational records may depend on the product setup.

### Why can a product delete fail?

Deletion can fail when the product is already used by tally sheets, shipments, or other linked records.
